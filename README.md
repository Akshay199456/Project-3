# Flutter : A Social Networking Site

## Hi everyone! Welcome to our Project 3!!! This project was completed by [Danny Wong](https://github.com/dawong8) and [Akshay Mysore](https://github.com/Akshay199456).



### Hosted Project Link: https://flutter-client.herokuapp.com/

The website that we came up with is **Flutter**. Flutter is a social networking site where you can post photos, comment on photos and follow other users of the site. It was our attempt of creating a full-stack application like Instagram given a time frame of 5 days. 

When you follow a person, you can also view the posts made by users followed by you. In addition, you can view posts made by you when you go to your profile page.  


### Technologies used:

The front end of the application was built using React. Express was used to design the backend while mongoDB was used to set up the database.

FontAwesome was used for displaying icons while Google Fonts was used to display font styles for the text. We also used Multer in order to upload images from the user's desktop.   

### Approach taken:

There was a lot of work that was put in from all the team members to make this product a success. In order to make it possible, we divided our work between each other. Dany and I divided the work among ourselves and built the site feature by feature.

### Bugs and Forthcoming features:

While we were able to discover bugs and fix them in our testing of the code, we would still love to hear from you about any other bugs that you might encounter.

With respect to forthcoming features, ooooh, we have a lot of them planned for future updates. 

	1. Recommend items to buy based on items that have been bought by the user.
	2. Convert the admin to seller and create a seller market similar to the items market.
	3. Use Stripe to authenticate payment for purchases made.
	4. Enable a shopping cart to purchase multiple items at once.
	5. Allowing the ability to upload images instead of inserting image url (**multer** seems like a start).
	6. Enable comments and ratings to be added to items in the market.
	7. Generate random images for the carousel that is available once you are logged in.
	8. Provide profile picture option for user and admin. 
	9. Confirm password authentication when updating profile password and creating account.
	10. Create a modal for an about section of the page.
	11. Allow multiple items to be placed on the market for sale.

Please let us know if you want us to add any other features that you would like. We are looking to expand our site in functionality and design so any recommendations will be happily accepted.
