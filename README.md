# Flutter : A Social Networking Site

## Hi everyone! Welcome to our Project 3!!! This project was completed by [Danny Wong](https://github.com/dawong8) and [Akshay Mysore](https://github.com/Akshay199456).


### Hosted Project Link: https://flutter-client.herokuapp.com/

The website that we came up with is **Flutter**. Flutter is a social networking site where you can post photos, comment on photos and follow other users of the site. It was our attempt of creating a full-stack application like Instagram given a time frame of 5 days. 

When you follow a person, you can also view the posts made by users followed by you. In addition, you can view posts made by you when you go to your profile page.  


### Technologies used:

The front end of the application was built using React. Express was used to design the backend while mongoDB was used to set up the database.

FontAwesome was used for displaying icons while Google Fonts was used to display font styles for the text. We also used Multer in order to upload images from the user's desktop.   

### Approach taken:

There was a lot of work that was put in from all the team members to make this product a success. In order to make it possible, we divided our work between each other. Dany and I divided the work among ourselves and built the site feature by feature.

### Bugs and Forthcoming features:

There are a few bugs that exist in the application:

	1. If you are logged into Facebook, you are automatically redirected to the home page of the application.
	2. If you try to upload the same item immediately after having it uploaded, the applications sometimes crashes.
	3. If you edit your username in the profile, you can follow your own post.


With respect to forthcoming features, ooooh, we have a lot of them planned for future updates. 

	1. Add the option to unfollow user and if unfollowed, remove that users posts from the followed posts.
	2. Payment authentication using Stripe
	3. Update followers number when someone followes/ unfollows.

Please let us know if you want us to add any other features that you would like. We are looking to expand our site in functionality and design so any recommendations will be happily accepted.
